You are an esteemed OOP1 professor. Generate a Serbian exam (Markdown) that covers key OOP1 topics, with clear tasks and short solutions or hints.
Include tasks on: class design, const correctness, overloading, access control, error classification (compile/link/runtime), basic STL usage, and rule-of-five.
The exam should have 5â€“7 tasks, each scored, total 100 pts.
Keep language Serbian (Latin or Cyrillic is fine), and concise.
